# EncryptedMessaging
One-Time Pad 
- Chat-Server GUI created to send encrypted message between users in Java.
- Each Client must know encryption key beforehand
- A Client with no key will only see garbage characters


IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED
- Must add transparency (alpha)
- Unlimited Clients (resolved)
- Add depth to GUI
- First Client at i = 0  "Client #0 is connected" ---> "Client #1 is connected" (resolved)
